=== For Loop

The *for* loop is more complex, but itâ€™s also the most commonly used loop.

In Python, the for loop is very powerful. It has a number of different forms, including one which is remarkably simple.

Maybe we have a list of donuts. 
And we want to print out each one.

[source]
----
list_of_donuts = ["chocolate", "glazed", "jelly"]

for donut in list_of_donuts:
    print(donut)

# you'll see as output
chocolate
glazed
jelly
----

This is called a *for-each* loop.
It steps thru the list, and *For Each* donut in list_of_donuts, it does whatever the code in its block specifies - here just printing out the donut.
It has the ability to iterate over the items of any sequence, such as a list or a string.
A _sequence_ here is a list, or a string, or a couple of other data structures we haven't yet talked about.

Just like slicing a string, a list (or any *sequence of data*) can be thought of a series of data point where the *index* start at zero and goes to *len(thing)-1*.
Just like a string "hello" which goes from 0..4, our donut list goes from 0..2 - in this example you see the *range()* function for the first time. And in python code, you see a lot of range().

[source]
----
list_of_donuts = ["chocolate", "glazed", "jelly"]

for index in range(len(list_of_donuts)):
    print(list_of_donuts[index])
----

Here the index was set to 0 and then 1, and then 2, and the index was used to retrieve from the list the donut name at the index. list_of_donuts[1] is "glazed". This example's out is the same as the for-each loop above.

Let's use range() is much more common usage.

Here's one where we go from 0 to 4.

[source]
----
for j in range(5):
    # loop body code
    print(j)
----

Notice how in this case, the loop prints out 0..4!

Now say we wanted to print out the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 10.

[]
----
# performing sum of 1 to 10
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 11): 
    sum = sum + i 
print("Sum of first 10 natural numbers is ", sum)
----

Wait! Notice how we have to ask range to *one beyond* the last number we want added to the sum! 
That's because the range starts at 0 and includes every whole number up to, but *not including*, the number that you have provided as the stop number.

There are three versions to the range()'s mechanism.

- range(stop) when you provide one number it acts as the stop value.
- range(start, stop) when you provide two numbers, the first is start, the second is stop.
- range(start, stop, step) when you provide three, they are taken to mean start, stop and step.

So if you have:

- range(5) gives 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- range(2, 5) gives 2, 3, 4
- range(1, 8, 2) gives 1, 3, 5, 7

Let's show you a glimpse of the *break* statement.

[source]
----
for p in range(1,6):
    if p == 4:
        break

print("Loop " + str(p) + " times")
----

Jumps out of the loop when p is equal to 4.

What about if we print from 10 to 1 with a for loop and a while loop (hint: we need to decrement).

[source]
----
for p in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(p)
----
Look, we had to range(10, 0, -1) to get the one to print. Otherwise if we had had used range(10,1,-1), we would have only printed 10 to 2.

The *range()* function gets used a lot in Python, and is the envy of many programmers in other languages who have use the *for* loop that was handed down from the C programming language.
So use it widely, and don't gloat -- too much :-)
